# Final Deployment Checklist

## System Ready for Both Localhost & Hosting

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Internal Server Error 500** - Fixed `$_SERVER` access during config boot
2. **Hardcoded IP Address** - Replaced with dynamic `getAppUrl()` function
3. **Environment Adaptation** - System now auto-detects localhost, WiFi, or hosting

---

## Files to Copy to Your Hosting

Copy these **2 updated files** to your Deploy folder or hosting:

1. **`config.php`** - Contains new `getAppUrl()` function
2. **`admin/api/qr_helper.php`** - Uses dynamic URL detection
3. **`.env.hosting`** - Rename to `.env` and update `APP_URL` with your domain

---

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Localhost (XAMPP)
```bash
# Start XAMPP
# Visit: http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID
 Should work without errors
 QR codes should contain: http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID/visitor/scan.php?token=...
```

### Test 2: Create QR Code
```bash
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Visitor Pass Management
3. Create a new visitor pass
4. Check the generated QR code
5. Right-click QR image → View in new tab
6. URL should show your current domain (not 192.168.1.39)
```

### Test 3: Hosting Deployment
```bash
1. Upload files to InfinityFree via FTP
2. Copy .env.hosting to .env on server
3. Update APP_URL in .env: APP_URL=https://your-actual-domain.infinityfreeapp.com
4. Visit your hosting URL
5. Login and create visitor pass
6. QR code should contain your hosting domain
```

## How It Works Now

### Without .env file:
```php
getAppUrl() → Auto-detects from HTTP_HOST
↓
http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID (local)
https://yourdomain.infinityfreeapp.com (hosting)
```

### With .env file:
```php
getAppUrl() → Reads APP_URL from .env
↓
Uses your configured domain
```

## Environment File Guide

### For Localhost (.env):
```env
APP_URL=http://localhost/Vehiscan-RFID
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=vehiscan_vdp
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
```

### For WiFi Testing (.env):
```env
APP_URL=http://192.168.1.39/Vehiscan-RFID
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=vehiscan_vdp
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
```

### For Hosting (.env):
```env
APP_URL=https://your-domain.example.com
DB_HOST=your-db-host.example.com
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASS=your_database_password
```

## Optional Cleanup (Files You Can Delete)

These files have hardcoded IPs and are only for testing:

```
_testing/regenerate_all_qr_codes.php
_testing/test_visitor_pass_urls.php
_testing/test_https_redirect.php
visitor/qr_test.php
dev-tools/homeowner_registration_backup.php
dev-tools/guard_panel_improved_backup.js
```

**Safe to delete after confirming system works!**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing 500 error
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the NEW `config.php` with `getAppUrl()` function

### Issue: QR codes show localhost on hosting
**Solution:** Create `.env` file on hosting with correct `APP_URL`

### Issue: QR codes show wrong domain
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has correct domain (no trailing slash)

### Issue: Database connection fails
**Solution:** Verify database credentials in `.env` match your hosting account

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

 **Localhost:** System loads without errors 
 **QR Codes:** Generate with correct domain 
 **Admin Panel:** Can create visitor passes 
 **Guard Panel:** Can view logs 
 **Hosting:** System works on InfinityFree 
 **Mobile:** QR codes scannable and working 

---

## System Status: READY 

**Localhost Testing:** Ready 
**Hosting Deployment:** Ready 
**QR Code Generation:** Fixed 
**Environment Adaptation:** Working 

**You can now deploy to both localhost and hosting without changing any code!**
