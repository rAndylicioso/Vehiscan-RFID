## Database Structure

-- Visitor access tokens  
visitor_auth_tokens (id, visitor_pass_id, token, expires_at)
```

### Enhanced Tables:
```sql
-- visitor_passes enhancements
status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'expired', 'used')
approved_by INT (admin who approved/rejected)
approved_at TIMESTAMP
rejection_reason TEXT
notes TEXT
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Execute the migration file
mysql -u root vehiscan_vdp < migrations/003_create_user_visitor_portals.sql
```

### 2. Create Homeowner Accounts
```sql
-- Example: Create login for existing homeowner
INSERT INTO homeowner_auth (homeowner_id, username, password_hash, email) 
VALUES (1, 'john_doe', '$2y$10$...', 'john@example.com');
```

### 3. Access Points
- **Homeowner Login**: `/homeowners/login.php`
- **Homeowner Portal**: `/homeowners/portal.php`
- **Visitor View**: `/visitor/view_pass.php?token={QR_TOKEN}`
- **Admin Approval**: Admin Panel → Visitor Passes

## Workflow

### Creating a Visitor Pass:
1. Homeowner logs in to portal
2. Clicks "Add Visitor Pass"
3. Fills form with visitor details
4. Submits → Status: **PENDING**
5. Admin receives notification in admin panel
6. Admin approves/rejects with reason
7. Homeowner sees updated status
8. If approved, visitor can access via QR code

### Visitor Access:
1. Homeowner shares QR code (contains token)
2. Visitor scans QR → opens `/visitor/view_pass.php?token=xxx`
3. Visitor sees:
   - Their pass details and validity
   - Homeowner's address
   - Contact information
4. Guard can verify pass status visually
